# This YAML file describes a hash of the web server configuration for this project.
# here's an example:
#
# --- 
# :test: 
#   :port: 46677
#   :server_names: 
#   - app-test.local
# :development: 
#   :port: 43273
#   :relative_root_url: /foo
#   :relative_root_url_root: true
#   :server_names: 
#   - sub-uri-app-foo-development.local
#   - sub-uri-apps-development.local
# :production: 
#   :port: 46767
#   :server_names: 
#   - app-production.local
#
# Visiting app-test.local will load the app in the test environment.
# Each vost that is configured will listen on all hostnames at the port specified, as well
# as port 80 on all the hostnames specfied.  In the above example accessing
# "http://localhost:46767" will go to the app in production mode, as well as
# "http://app-production.local".
#
# You can also see how to setup relative_root_url apps here in the development section.
# All apps that share a server name and have relative_root_url specified will be setup for relative root access.
# Say, for example, another app had the following config:
#
# --- 
# :development: 
#   :port: 44893
#   :relative_root_url: /bar
#   :server_names: 
#   - sub-uri-app-bar-development.local
#   - sub-uri-apps-development.local
#
# Since these two apps share the server name "sub-uri-apps-development.local" and have relative_root_url
# specified they will be configured so that accessing "http://sub-uri-apps-development.local/foo"
# goes to the first app and accessing "http://sub-uri-apps-development.local/bar" goes to the second.
# In addition, by specifying relative_root_url_root for the foo app you ca visit
# "http://sub-uri-apps-development.local/" and you will access the foo app.
